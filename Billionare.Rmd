## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
Billionaires_cleaned <- na.omit(Billionaires) %>%
  distinct(Name, .keep_all = TRUE)

sum(is.na(Billionaires_cleaned))

Billionaires_cleaned %>%
  count(Name) %>%
  filter (n > 1)

print(Billionaires$NetWorth)



Billionaires_cleaned %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NetWorth)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 30, color = "red", fill = "white") + labs(title = "Net Worth")




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
NetWorthLabel = c("1 - 88.5", "88.6 - 177")
Billionaires_cleaned$NetWorth_Group = cut(Billionaires_cleaned$NetWorth, breaks = c(1, 88.5, Inf), labels = NetWorthLabel, right = FALSE)
ggplot(data = Billionaires_cleaned, mapping = aes(x = NetWorth_Group, y = Age)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0, color = "red", fill = "white") + geom_jitter(color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) + labs(title = "Forbes Billionaires 2021 by Age")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
